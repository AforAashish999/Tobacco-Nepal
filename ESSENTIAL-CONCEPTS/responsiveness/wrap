By default, a flex container tries to fit all its items in one single line, even if they overflow the container.

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* default */
  flex-wrap: nowrap;   /* default */
}


nowrap → everything stays on one line (default)

wrap → items move to the next line if they don’t fit

wrap-reverse → same as wrap, but lines go in reverse order
