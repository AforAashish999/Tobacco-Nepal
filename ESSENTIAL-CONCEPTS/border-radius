why does border-radius doesnt work 
.video{
    padding: 32px;
    height:421.33px;
    width: 100%;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3,1fr);
    gap: 24px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.video__item{
    height: 100%;
background-color: green;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
}
.video__video{
    background-color: red;
    flex: 1;
    position: relative;
}
.video__content{
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
position: absolute;
    object-fit: cover;
}
.video__description{
    padding: 16px
}
.video__heading{
        color: var(--color-orange-400);
        font-size: 18px;
        font-weight: 600;
}
.video__subHeading{
    font-size: 14px;
    color: var(--color-gray-300);
}
explain me the concept so i dont get confused in future

This is a very good question, and the confusion is extremely common. The issue is not a bug and not specific to video — it is about how border-radius and clipping actually work in CSS layouts.

I’ll explain the concept first, then map it directly to your code, so you can reason about this correctly in the future.

Core concept (memorize this)

border-radius only affects the element it is applied to.
It does NOT automatically clip grandchildren unless overflow rules allow it.

More precisely:

border-radius changes the shape of an element’s border box

Clipping only happens if overflow is not visible

Absolutely positioned children ignore the parent’s border unless clipped

Why your border-radius does not appear

You applied this:

.video {
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden;
}


But the visual element you care about is not the .video container.

Your visual hierarchy:
.video (grid container)
└── .video__item (green)
    ├── .video__video (red, relative)
    │   └── <video> (absolute, filling)
    └── .video__description


The rounded corners are on .video,
but the visible content (red + video) lives inside grid children that:

stretch edge-to-edge

are not themselves rounded

are not clipped at their own boundaries

So visually:

the grid container is rounded

but the children completely fill it

so the corners look square

Absolute positioning makes this more obvious

This is the key detail you must remember:

Absolutely positioned elements do not respect border-radius unless the element that has the radius is also clipping them.

Your <video>:

.video__content {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
}


It is clipped only by:

its nearest ancestor with overflow: hidden

That ancestor is .video__video, not .video.

But .video__video has no border-radius.

The correct mental model
Border-radius is not inherited

Each layer must define its own clipping if it visually matters.

Think in layers:

Layer	Has radius?	Has overflow hidden?	Clips children?
.video	Yes	Yes	Yes
.video__item	No	No	No
.video__video	No	No	No
<video>	No	N/A	N/A

So nothing visually clips at the video level.

Correct solutions (choose based on intent)
✅ Solution 1: Radius where the visual edge actually is (recommended)

If each card should be rounded:

.video__item {
  border-radius: 12px;
  overflow: hidden;
}


This is the most correct approach for card layouts.

✅ Solution 2: Radius only on the video area

If only the video needs rounding:

.video__video {
  border-radius: 12px;
  overflow: hidden;
}


Now the absolutely positioned <video> is clipped correctly.

❌ Solution that looks right but is conceptually wrong

Relying on .video (grid container) to clip children:

.video {
  border-radius: 12px;
}


This only works if:

children do not touch the edges

no absolute positioning is involved

Not your case.

One-sentence rule for the future

Apply border-radius + overflow: hidden to the element that visually touches the edge of what you want rounded.

Never apply it “higher up” and expect it to trickle down.

Why images sometimes “work” but videos don’t

Images often appear to respect radius because:

they are not absolutely positioned

they size naturally

they sit inside padded containers

Videos with position: absolute expose the real CSS rules.

Final takeaway (important)

border-radius is local, not global

Absolute children ignore radius unless clipped

Clip at the visual boundary, not the layout container

Grid containers are rarely the right place for rounding

Once you internalize this, border-radius bugs stop being confusing.
