there was a html tag i studied, that lets what i type same as in website, it doesnt remove spaces
ChatGPT said:

The HTML tag you are thinking of is:

<pre>

The <pre> tag preserves all spaces, line breaks, tabs, and formatting exactly as you write it.

Example:

<pre>
Hello     world
   this    text
will stay    exactly
as typed
</pre>


On the website, it will appear exactly the same — no collapsing of spaces.

Why?

HTML normally collapses multiple spaces into one.
<pre> disables that behavior.

Optional: Using CSS instead

If you want any element to preserve spaces without using <pre>:

white-space: pre-wrap;


Example:

<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
    Hello     world
</div>


If you want, I can show you when to use <pre> vs white-space: pre-wrap.

Here is the clear and professional guidance on when to use <pre> and when to use white-space: pre-wrap. This is exactly how developers decide which one to use.

1. Use <pre> when:
You want the text to look EXACTLY like raw source text

Keeps all spaces, tabs, newlines

Uses a monospace font by default

Browser treats it like a “block of raw text”

Best for:

Code blocks

Logs

ASCII art

Configuration snippets

Example:
<pre>
function test() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
</pre>


You get:

Fixed-width font

Exact indentation

Spaces preserved

2. Use white-space: pre-wrap when:
You want spaces + line breaks preserved BUT want normal styling

Uses your normal font, not monospace

Text wraps to next line (pre does not wrap)

You can style it normally

Best for:

Chat messages

User-entered notes

Paragraphs where spacing matters

Any formatted text in a UI

Example:
<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Hello     this    keeps      the   spaces
but wraps normally and uses your site's font.
</div>

Quick Decision Guide
Need	Use
Preserve all spaces and newlines	<pre>
Show code/logs with fixed-width text	<pre>
Preserve spaces but keep normal font	white-space: pre-wrap;
Want long lines to wrap automatically	pre-wrap
Want full CSS control	pre-wrap
Which should YOU use most of the time?

For modern web apps (React, Next.js), the recommended approach is:

Use white-space: pre-wrap
Because it works well with normal fonts and responsive layouts.
