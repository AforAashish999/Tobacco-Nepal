  const { productId } = params;

  return (
    <div className={styles.wrapper}>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>Product ID: {productId}</h1>
      <p className={styles.desc}>Product details go here...</p>
    </div>
  );

What you’re using here is CSS Modules, and yes, in many cases it’s considered “better” than plain/global CSS for React/Next.js projects. Here’s why:

Advantages of CSS Modules
Scoped Styles

Each class name is local to the component by default.

No risk of accidentally overwriting styles elsewhere.

Example: styles.wrapper compiles to something like wrapper__abc123.

Easier Maintenance

You can see which styles belong to which component.

Cleaner organization for large projects.

Supports Dynamic Class Names

You can combine class names conditionally using libraries like clsx or just template strings:

<div className={`${styles.wrapper} ${isActive ? styles.active : ""}`}></div>
No Global Pollution

Unlike traditional CSS, you don’t have to worry about h1 or .title affecting other pages/components.

Downsides Compared to Normal CSS
Extra Build Step

Next.js handles it automatically, but plain CSS just works in HTML too.

Limited Global Styling

You still need a global CSS file for things like body, html, fonts, or resets.

When to Use
CSS Modules: Component-specific styling, small reusable components.

Global CSS: Resets, fonts, body background, themes, and utility classes (like Tailwind).

So yes, for your product.module.css example, this is cleaner and safer than normal CSS for a component-based project.

If you want, I can also show a slightly better approach using Tailwind + CSS Modules hybrid for even cleaner styling in Next.js. Do you want me to?
