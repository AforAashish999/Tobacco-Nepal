Commit Message Convention (Simple & Clean)

Use this pattern:

type(scope): short description


Examples:

feat(blog): add hero section
feat(blog): add second section
style(blog): adjust hero spacing
fix(blog): correct grid hover behavior

What You Should Avoid

❌ One big commit:

"blog page changes"


❌ Micro commits:

"fixed padding"
"changed color"
"another fix"


You want meaningful granularity, not noise.

feat(blog): add hero section
feat(blog): add second section
feat(auth): implement login flow
feat(products): add product grid


Other Common Commit Types (You Should Know These)
Type	Meaning
feat	New feature
fix	Bug fix
style	Formatting, spacing, CSS-only changes
refactor	Code improvement without behavior change
chore	Tooling, configs, dependencies
docs	Documentation
test	Tests added or updated


1. Stage all changes except the files you don’t want

Suppose you have these changes:

M file1.js
M file2.js   <-- don't want to commit
M file3.js


Use:

git add .
git reset file2.js


git add . → stages everything

git reset file2.js → unstages the file you don’t want

Then commit:

git commit -m "Commit message"
