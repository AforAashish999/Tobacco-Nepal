Commit Message Convention (Simple & Clean)

Use this pattern:

type(scope): short description


Examples:

feat(blog): add hero section
feat(blog): add second section
style(blog): adjust hero spacing
fix(blog): correct grid hover behavior

What You Should Avoid

❌ One big commit:

"blog page changes"


❌ Micro commits:

"fixed padding"
"changed color"
"another fix"


You want meaningful granularity, not noise.

feat(blog): add hero section
feat(blog): add second section
feat(auth): implement login flow
feat(products): add product grid
